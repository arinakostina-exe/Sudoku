# Sudoku

This is a Sudoku app built with the SFML library and backtracking algorithm.

This is a simple sudoku app where you can play with randomely generated templates every time.
To change the difficulty level you have to change manually the value of the diff variable in the Main.cpp file.
To generate a new template press space bar.
To put a value, click on the position you want to place it and press the according number on the keyboard.
The Makefile contains the commands to run the program. You have to change the paths to wherever you have your SFML library installed, otherwise it will not run !!!!!

Thank you,
Enjoy the game :)
